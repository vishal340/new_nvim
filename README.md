This is my latest nvim config with lazy.
My last [config](https://github.com/vishal340/nvim_config) was with packer and I won't be using it anymore.

This has 2 working branches. The cmp branch is using [nvim_cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp). I recently moved away from it to [blink.cmp](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.nvim) as the completion plugin.

The pdf viewer configured it to be "sioyek".
